# Landmark-detection-openCV
create a python program that uses openCV to read from your laptop camera and put a sunglass filter in real-time as pointed in the <a href="https://cfml.se/blog/facial_landmark_detection/"> document </a>

also we make <br>
- hyperparameter optimization for cnn 
- create basline model
- prediction landmark on real-life image
- put sunglasses on real-life image
